# Debugging

If the agent is stuck or behaving unexpectedly:

1. **Clear Context**: Start a new session or ask the agent to "forget previous instructions" if confused.
2. **Explicit Instructions**: Be extremely specific about paths, filenames, and desired outcomes.
3. **Logs**: Ask the agent to "check the logs" or "run the command with verbose output".

## Best Practices

1. **Small Contexts**: Don't dump the entire codebase into the context. Use `grep` or `find` to locate relevant files first.
2. **Iterative Development**: Ask for small changes, verify, then proceed.
3. **Feedback Loop**: If the agent makes a mistake, correct it immediately and ask it to "add a lesson" to its memory (if supported) or `CLAUDE.md`.
