from main import app

@pytest.fixture
async def client():
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://test") as ac:
        yield ac

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_health_check(client: AsyncClient):
    response = await client.get("/health")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.json()["status"] == "healthy"
