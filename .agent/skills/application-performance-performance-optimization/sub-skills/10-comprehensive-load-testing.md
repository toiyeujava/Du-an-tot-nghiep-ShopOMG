# 10. Comprehensive Load Testing

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="performance-engineer"
- Prompt: "Conduct comprehensive load testing for: $ARGUMENTS using k6/Gatling/Artillery. Design realistic load scenarios based on production traffic patterns. Test normal load, peak load, and stress scenarios. Include API testing, browser-based testing, and WebSocket testing if applicable. Measure response times, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization at various load levels."
- Context: All optimizations from phases 1-3
- Output: Load test results, performance under load, breaking points, scalability analysis
