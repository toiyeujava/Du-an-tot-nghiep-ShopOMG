# 6. Microservices & Distributed System Optimization

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="performance-engineer"
- Prompt: "Optimize distributed system performance for: $ARGUMENTS. Analyze service-to-service communication, implement service mesh optimizations, optimize message queue performance (Kafka/RabbitMQ), reduce network hops. Implement distributed caching strategies and optimize serialization/deserialization."
- Context: Backend optimizations from step 5
- Output: Service communication improvements, message queue optimization, distributed caching setup

## Phase 3: Frontend & CDN Optimization
