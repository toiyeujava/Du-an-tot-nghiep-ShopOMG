# Architectural Coherence

1. **Dependency Direction**: Inner layers don't depend on outer layers
2. **SOLID Principles**:
   - Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution
   - Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
3. **Anti-patterns**:
   - Singleton (global state), God objects (>500 lines, >20 methods)
   - Anemic models, Shotgun surgery
