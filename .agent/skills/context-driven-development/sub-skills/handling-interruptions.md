# Handling Interruptions

If interrupted mid-task:

1. Mark task as `[~]` with note about stopping point
2. Commit work-in-progress to feature branch
3. Document any uncommitted decisions in plan.md

## Best Practices

1. **Read context first**: Always read relevant artifacts before starting work
2. **Small updates**: Make incremental context changes, not massive rewrites
3. **Link decisions**: Reference context when making implementation choices
4. **Version context**: Commit context changes alongside code changes
5. **Review context**: Include context artifact reviews in code reviews
6. **Validate regularly**: Run context validation checklist before major work
7. **Communicate changes**: Notify team when context artifacts change significantly
8. **Preserve history**: Use git to track context evolution over time
9. **Question staleness**: If context feels wrong, investigate and update
10. **Keep it actionable**: Every context item should inform a decision or behavior
