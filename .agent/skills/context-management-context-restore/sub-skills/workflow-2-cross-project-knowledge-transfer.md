# Workflow 2: Cross-Project Knowledge Transfer

1. Extract semantic vectors from source project
2. Map and transfer relevant knowledge
3. Adapt context to target project's domain
4. Validate knowledge transferability

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Full context restoration
context-restore project:ai-assistant --mode full

# Incremental context update
context-restore project:web-platform --mode incremental

# Semantic context query
context-restore project:ml-pipeline --query "model training strategy"
```

## Integration Patterns
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipelines
- Multi-agent workflow coordination
- Continuous learning systems
- Enterprise knowledge management

## Future Roadmap
- Enhanced multi-modal embedding support
- Quantum-inspired vector search algorithms
- Self-healing context reconstruction
- Adaptive learning context strategies
