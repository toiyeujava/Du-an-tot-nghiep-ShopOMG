# Workflow 2: Long-Running Session Context Management

1. Periodically capture context snapshots
2. Detect significant architectural changes
3. Version and archive context
4. Enable selective context restoration

## Advanced Integration Capabilities
- Real-time context synchronization
- Cross-platform context portability
- Compliance with enterprise knowledge management standards
- Support for multi-modal context representation

## Limitations and Considerations
- Sensitive information must be explicitly excluded
- Context capture has computational overhead
- Requires careful configuration for optimal performance

## Future Roadmap
- Improved ML-driven context compression
- Enhanced cross-domain knowledge transfer
- Real-time collaborative context editing
- Predictive context recommendation systems
