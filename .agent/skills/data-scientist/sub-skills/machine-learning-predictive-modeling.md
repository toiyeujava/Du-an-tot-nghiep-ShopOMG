# Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling

- Supervised learning: linear/logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Unsupervised learning: clustering (K-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN), PCA, t-SNE, UMAP
- Deep learning: neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, transformers with PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Ensemble methods: bagging, boosting, stacking, voting classifiers
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation and Optuna
- Feature engineering: selection, extraction, transformation, encoding categorical variables
- Dimensionality reduction and feature importance analysis
- Model interpretability: SHAP, LIME, feature attribution, partial dependence plots
