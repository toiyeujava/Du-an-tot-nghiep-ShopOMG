# Normalization vs Denormalization

- **Normalization benefits**: Data consistency, update efficiency, storage optimization
- **Denormalization strategies**: Read performance optimization, reduced JOIN complexity
- **Trade-off analysis**: Write vs read patterns, consistency requirements, query complexity
- **Hybrid approaches**: Selective denormalization, materialized views, derived columns
- **OLTP vs OLAP**: Transaction processing vs analytical workload optimization
- **Aggregate patterns**: Pre-computed aggregations, incremental updates, refresh strategies
- **Dimensional modeling**: Star schema, snowflake schema, fact and dimension tables
