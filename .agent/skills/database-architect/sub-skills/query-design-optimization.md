# Query Design & Optimization

- **Query patterns**: Read-heavy, write-heavy, analytical, transactional patterns
- **JOIN strategies**: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL joins, cross joins, semi/anti joins
- **Subquery optimization**: Correlated subqueries, derived tables, CTEs, materialization
- **Window functions**: Ranking, running totals, moving averages, partition-based analysis
- **Aggregation patterns**: GROUP BY optimization, HAVING clauses, cube/rollup operations
- **Query hints**: Optimizer hints, index hints, join hints (when appropriate)
- **Prepared statements**: Parameterized queries, plan caching, SQL injection prevention
- **Batch operations**: Bulk inserts, batch updates, upsert patterns, merge operations
