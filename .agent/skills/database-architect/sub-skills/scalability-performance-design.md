# Scalability & Performance Design

- **Vertical scaling**: Resource optimization, instance sizing, performance tuning
- **Horizontal scaling**: Read replicas, load balancing, connection pooling
- **Partitioning strategies**: Range, hash, list, composite partitioning
- **Sharding design**: Shard key selection, resharding strategies, cross-shard queries
- **Replication patterns**: Master-slave, master-master, multi-region replication
- **Consistency models**: Strong consistency, eventual consistency, causal consistency
- **Connection pooling**: Pool sizing, connection lifecycle, timeout configuration
- **Load distribution**: Read/write splitting, geographic distribution, workload isolation
- **Storage optimization**: Compression, columnar storage, tiered storage
- **Capacity planning**: Growth projections, resource forecasting, performance baselines
