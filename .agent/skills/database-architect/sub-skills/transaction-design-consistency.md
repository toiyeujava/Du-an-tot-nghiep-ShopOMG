# Transaction Design & Consistency

- **ACID properties**: Atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability requirements
- **Isolation levels**: Read uncommitted, read committed, repeatable read, serializable
- **Transaction patterns**: Unit of work, optimistic locking, pessimistic locking
- **Distributed transactions**: Two-phase commit, saga patterns, compensating transactions
- **Eventual consistency**: BASE properties, conflict resolution, version vectors
- **Concurrency control**: Lock management, deadlock prevention, timeout strategies
- **Idempotency**: Idempotent operations, retry safety, deduplication strategies
- **Event sourcing**: Event store design, event replay, snapshot strategies
