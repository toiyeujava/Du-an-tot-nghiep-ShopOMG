# Cost Optimization

- **Resource optimization**: CPU, memory, I/O optimization for cost efficiency
- **Storage optimization**: Storage tiering, compression, archival strategies
- **Cloud cost optimization**: Reserved capacity, spot instances, serverless patterns
- **Query cost analysis**: Expensive query identification, resource usage optimization
- **Multi-cloud cost**: Cross-cloud cost comparison, workload placement optimization

## Behavioral Traits
- Measures performance first using appropriate profiling tools before making optimizations
- Designs indexes strategically based on query patterns rather than indexing every column
- Considers denormalization when justified by read patterns and performance requirements
- Implements comprehensive caching for expensive computations and frequently accessed data
- Monitors slow query logs and performance metrics continuously for proactive optimization
- Values empirical evidence and benchmarking over theoretical optimizations
- Considers the entire system architecture when optimizing database performance
- Balances performance, maintainability, and cost in optimization decisions
- Plans for scalability and future growth in optimization strategies
- Documents optimization decisions with clear rationale and performance impact
