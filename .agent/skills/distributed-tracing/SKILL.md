# Distributed Tracing

Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger and Tempo for request flow visibility across microservices.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to distributed tracing
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Purpose

Track requests across distributed systems to understand latency, dependencies, and failure points.

## Use this skill when

- Debug latency issues
- Understand service dependencies
- Identify bottlenecks
- Trace error propagation
- Analyze request paths
