# 4. Result Aggregation and Synthesis

- **Intelligent Consolidation**:
  - Merge insights from multiple agents
  - Resolve conflicting recommendations
  - Generate unified, prioritized report
- **Synthesis Algorithm**:
  ```python
  def synthesize_review_insights(agent_results):
      consolidated_report = {
          "critical_issues": [],
          "important_issues": [],
          "improvement_suggestions": []
      }
      # Intelligent merging logic
      return consolidated_report
  ```
