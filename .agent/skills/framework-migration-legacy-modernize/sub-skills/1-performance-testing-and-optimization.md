# 1. Performance Testing and Optimization

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="application-performance::performance-engineer"
- Prompt: "Conduct performance testing comparing legacy vs modernized components. Run load tests simulating production traffic patterns, measure response times, throughput, and resource utilization. Identify performance regressions and optimize: database queries with indexing, caching strategies (Redis/Memcached), connection pooling, and async processing where applicable. Validate against SLA requirements."
- Context from previous: Performance baselines, modernized components
- Expected output: Performance test results and optimization recommendations
