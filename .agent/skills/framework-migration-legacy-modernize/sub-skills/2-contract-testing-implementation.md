# 2. Contract Testing Implementation

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="unit-testing::test-automator"
- Prompt: "Implement contract tests for all integration points identified in dependency mapping. Create consumer-driven contracts for APIs, message queue interactions, and database schemas. Set up contract verification in CI/CD pipeline. Generate performance baselines for response times and throughput to validate modernized components maintain SLAs."
- Context from previous: Integration point catalog, existing test coverage
- Expected output: Contract test suite with performance baselines
