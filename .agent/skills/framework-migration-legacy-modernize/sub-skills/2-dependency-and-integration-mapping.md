# 2. Dependency and Integration Mapping

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="architect-review"
- Prompt: "Based on the legacy assessment report, create a comprehensive dependency graph showing: internal module dependencies, external service integrations, shared database schemas, and cross-system data flows. Identify integration points that will require facade patterns or adapter layers during migration. Highlight circular dependencies and tight coupling that need resolution."
- Context from previous: Legacy assessment report, component complexity scores
- Expected output: Visual dependency map and integration point catalog
