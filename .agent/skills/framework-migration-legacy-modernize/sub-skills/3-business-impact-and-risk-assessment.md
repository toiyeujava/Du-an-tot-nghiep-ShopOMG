# 3. Business Impact and Risk Assessment

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="business-analytics::business-analyst"
- Prompt: "Evaluate business impact of modernizing each component identified. Create risk assessment matrix considering: business criticality (revenue impact), user traffic patterns, data sensitivity, regulatory requirements, and fallback complexity. Prioritize components using a weighted scoring system: (Business Value × 0.4) + (Technical Risk × 0.3) + (Quick Win Potential × 0.3). Define rollback strategies for each component."
- Context from previous: Component inventory, dependency mapping
- Expected output: Prioritized migration roadmap with risk mitigation strategies
