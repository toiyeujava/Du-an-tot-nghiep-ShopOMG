- Use Task tool with subagent_type="security-scanning::security-auditor"
- Prompt: "Audit modernized components for security vulnerabilities. Implement security improvements including: OAuth 2.0/JWT authentication, role-based access control, input validation and sanitization, SQL injection prevention, XSS protection, and secrets management. Verify OWASP top 10 compliance. Configure security headers and implement rate limiting."
- Context from previous: Modernized component code
- Expected output: Security audit report and hardened components
