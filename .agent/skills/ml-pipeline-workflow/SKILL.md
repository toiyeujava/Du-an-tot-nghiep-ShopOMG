# ML Pipeline Workflow

Complete end-to-end MLOps pipeline orchestration from data preparation through model deployment.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to ml pipeline workflow
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Overview

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for building production ML pipelines that handle the full lifecycle: data ingestion → preparation → training → validation → deployment → monitoring.

## Use this skill when

- Building new ML pipelines from scratch
- Designing workflow orchestration for ML systems
- Implementing data → model → deployment automation
- Setting up reproducible training workflows
- Creating DAG-based ML orchestration
- Integrating ML components into production systems
