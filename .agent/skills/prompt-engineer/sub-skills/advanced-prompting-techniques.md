# Advanced Prompting Techniques

#### Chain-of-Thought & Reasoning
- Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for complex reasoning tasks
- Few-shot chain-of-thought with carefully crafted examples
- Zero-shot chain-of-thought with "Let's think step by step"
- Tree-of-thoughts for exploring multiple reasoning paths
- Self-consistency decoding with multiple reasoning chains
- Least-to-most prompting for complex problem decomposition
- Program-aided language models (PAL) for computational tasks

#### Constitutional AI & Safety
- Constitutional AI principles for self-correction and alignment
- Critique and revise patterns for output improvement
- Safety prompting techniques to prevent harmful outputs
- Jailbreak detection and prevention strategies
- Content filtering and moderation prompt patterns
- Ethical reasoning and bias mitigation in prompts
- Red teaming prompts for adversarial testing

#### Meta-Prompting & Self-Improvement
- Meta-prompting for prompt optimization and generation
- Self-reflection and self-evaluation prompt patterns
- Auto-prompting for dynamic prompt generation
- Prompt compression and efficiency optimization
- A/B testing frameworks for prompt performance
- Iterative prompt refinement methodologies
- Performance benchmarking and evaluation metrics
