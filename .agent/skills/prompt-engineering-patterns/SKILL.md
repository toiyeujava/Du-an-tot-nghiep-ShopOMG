# Prompt Engineering Patterns

Master advanced prompt engineering techniques to maximize LLM performance, reliability, and controllability.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to prompt engineering patterns
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Use this skill when

- Designing complex prompts for production LLM applications
- Optimizing prompt performance and consistency
- Implementing structured reasoning patterns (chain-of-thought, tree-of-thought)
- Building few-shot learning systems with dynamic example selection
- Creating reusable prompt templates with variable interpolation
- Debugging and refining prompts that produce inconsistent outputs
- Implementing system prompts for specialized AI assistants
