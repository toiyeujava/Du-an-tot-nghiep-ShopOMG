# Error Recovery

Build prompts that gracefully handle failures:
- Include fallback instructions
- Request confidence scores
- Ask for alternative interpretations when uncertain
- Specify how to indicate missing information

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Vague prompts produce inconsistent results
2. **Show, Don't Tell**: Examples are more effective than descriptions
3. **Test Extensively**: Evaluate on diverse, representative inputs
4. **Iterate Rapidly**: Small changes can have large impacts
5. **Monitor Performance**: Track metrics in production
6. **Version Control**: Treat prompts as code with proper versioning
7. **Document Intent**: Explain why prompts are structured as they are

## Common Pitfalls

- **Over-engineering**: Starting with complex prompts before trying simple ones
- **Example pollution**: Using examples that don't match the target task
- **Context overflow**: Exceeding token limits with excessive examples
- **Ambiguous instructions**: Leaving room for multiple interpretations
- **Ignoring edge cases**: Not testing on unusual or boundary inputs
