# Django Best Practices

```
Model design:
├── Fat models, thin views
├── Use managers for common queries
├── Abstract base classes for shared fields

Views:
├── Class-based for complex CRUD
├── Function-based for simple endpoints
├── Use viewsets with DRF

Queries:
├── select_related() for FKs
├── prefetch_related() for M2M
├── Avoid N+1 queries
└── Use .only() for specific fields
```
