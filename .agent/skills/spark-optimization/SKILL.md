# Apache Spark Optimization

Production patterns for optimizing Apache Spark jobs including partitioning strategies, memory management, shuffle optimization, and performance tuning.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to apache spark optimization
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Use this skill when

- Optimizing slow Spark jobs
- Tuning memory and executor configuration
- Implementing efficient partitioning strategies
- Debugging Spark performance issues
- Scaling Spark pipelines for large datasets
- Reducing shuffle and data skew
