# Funding Scenario Modeling

**Pre-Money Valuation:**
Based on metrics and comparables.

**Dilution:**
```
Post-Money = Pre-Money + Investment
Dilution % = Investment / Post-Money
```

**Use of Funds:**
Allocate funding to extend runway and achieve milestones.

**Example:**
```
Raise: $5M at $20M pre-money
Post-Money: $25M
Dilution: 20%

Use of Funds:
- Product Development: $2M (40%)
- Sales & Marketing: $2M (40%)
- G&A and Operations: $0.5M (10%)
- Working Capital: $0.5M (10%)
