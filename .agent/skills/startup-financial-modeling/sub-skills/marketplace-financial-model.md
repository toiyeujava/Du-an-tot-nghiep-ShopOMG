# Marketplace Financial Model

**Revenue Drivers:**
- GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)
- Take rate (% of GMV)
- Net revenue = GMV × Take rate

**Key Ratios:**
- Take rate: 10-30% depending on category
- CAC for buyers vs. sellers
- Contribution margin: 60-70%

**Example Projection:**
```
Year 1: $5M GMV, 15% take rate = $750K revenue
Year 2: $20M GMV, 15% take rate = $3M revenue
Year 3: $60M GMV, 15% take rate = $9M revenue
```
