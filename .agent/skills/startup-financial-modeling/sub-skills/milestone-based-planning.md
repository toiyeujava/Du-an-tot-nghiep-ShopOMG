# Milestone-Based Planning

**Identify Key Milestones:**
- Product launch
- First $1M ARR
- Break-even on CAC
- Series A fundraise

**Funding Amount:**
Ensure runway to achieve next milestone + 6 months buffer.

## Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall 1: Overly Optimistic Revenue**
- New startups rarely hit aggressive projections
- Use conservative customer acquisition assumptions
- Model realistic churn rates

**Pitfall 2: Underestimating Costs**
- Add 20% buffer to expense estimates
- Include fully-loaded compensation
- Account for software and tools

**Pitfall 3: Ignoring Cash Flow Timing**
- Revenue ≠ cash (payment terms)
- Expenses paid before revenue collected
- Model cash conversion carefully

**Pitfall 4: Static Headcount**
- Hiring takes time (3-6 months to fill roles)
- Ramp time for productivity (3-6 months)
- Account for attrition (10-15% annually)

**Pitfall 5: Not Scenario Planning**
- Single scenario is never accurate
- Always model conservative case
- Plan for what you'll do if base case fails

## Model Validation

**Sanity Checks:**
- [ ] Revenue growth rate is achievable (3x in Year 2, 2x in Year 3)
- [ ] Unit economics are realistic (LTV/CAC > 3, payback < 18 months)
- [ ] Burn multiple is reasonable (< 2.0 in Year 2-3)
- [ ] Headcount scales with revenue (revenue per employee growing)
- [ ] Gross margin is appropriate for business model
- [ ] S&M spending aligns with CAC and growth targets

**Benchmark Against Peers:**
Compare key metrics to similar companies at similar stage.

**Investor Feedback:**
Share model with advisors or investors for feedback on assumptions.
