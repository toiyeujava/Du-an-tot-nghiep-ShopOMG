# Revenue Model

**Cohort-Based Projections:**
Build revenue from customer acquisition and retention by cohort.

**Formula:**
```
MRR = Σ (Cohort Size × Retention Rate × ARPU)
ARR = MRR × 12
```

**Key Inputs:**
- Monthly new customer acquisitions
- Customer retention rates by month
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
- Pricing and packaging assumptions
- Expansion revenue (upsells, cross-sells)
