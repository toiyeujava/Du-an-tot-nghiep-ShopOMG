# Step 4: Create Hiring Plan

Model headcount growth by role and department.

**Inputs:**
- Starting headcount
- Hiring velocity by role
- Fully-loaded compensation by role
- Benefits and taxes (typically 1.3-1.4x salary)

**Example:**
```
Engineer: $150K salary × 1.35 = $202K fully-loaded
Sales Rep: $100K OTE × 1.30 = $130K fully-loaded
```
