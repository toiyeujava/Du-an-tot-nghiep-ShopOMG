# Step 5: Project Cash Flow

Calculate monthly cash position and runway.

**Monthly Cash Flow:**
```
Beginning Cash
+ Revenue Collected (consider payment terms)
- Operating Expenses Paid
- CapEx
= Ending Cash
```

**Runway Calculation:**
```
If Ending Cash < 0:
  Funding Need = Negative Cash Balance
  Runway = 0
Else:
  Runway = Ending Cash / Average Monthly Burn
```
