# Async/Await and Execution Models

**Three Execution Patterns** (Source: docs.temporal.io):

1. **Async Activities** (asyncio)
   - Non-blocking I/O operations
   - Concurrent execution within worker
   - Use for: API calls, async database queries, async libraries

2. **Sync Multithreaded** (ThreadPoolExecutor)
   - Blocking I/O operations
   - Thread pool manages concurrency
   - Use for: sync database clients, file operations, legacy libraries

3. **Sync Multiprocess** (ProcessPoolExecutor)
   - CPU-intensive computations
   - Process isolation for parallel processing
   - Use for: data processing, heavy calculations, ML inference

**Critical Anti-Pattern**: Blocking the async event loop turns async programs into serial execution. Always use sync activities for blocking operations.
