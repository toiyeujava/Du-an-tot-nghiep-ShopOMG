# Signal and Query Patterns

**Signals** (External Events)

- Signal handler implementation with `@workflow.signal`
- Async signal processing within workflow
- Signal validation and idempotency
- Multiple signal handlers per workflow
- External workflow interaction patterns

**Queries** (State Inspection)

- Query handler implementation with `@workflow.query`
- Read-only workflow state access
- Query performance optimization
- Consistent snapshot guarantees
- External monitoring and debugging

**Dynamic Handlers**

- Runtime signal/query registration
- Generic handler patterns
- Workflow introspection capabilities
