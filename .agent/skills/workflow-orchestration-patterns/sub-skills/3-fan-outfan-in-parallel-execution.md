# 3. Fan-Out/Fan-In (Parallel Execution)

**Purpose**: Execute multiple tasks in parallel, aggregate results

**Pattern:**

- Spawn child workflows or parallel activities
- Wait for all to complete
- Aggregate results
- Handle partial failures

**Scaling Rule** (Source: temporal.io/blog/workflow-engine-principles):

- Don't scale individual workflows
- For 1M tasks: spawn 1K child workflows × 1K tasks each
- Keep each workflow bounded
