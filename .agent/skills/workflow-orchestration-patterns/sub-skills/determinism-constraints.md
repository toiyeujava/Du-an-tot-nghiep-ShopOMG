# Determinism Constraints

**Workflows Execute as State Machines**:

- Replay behavior must be consistent
- Same inputs → identical outputs every time

**Prohibited in Workflows** (Source: docs.temporal.io/workflows):

- ❌ Threading, locks, synchronization primitives
- ❌ Random number generation (`random()`)
- ❌ Global state or static variables
- ❌ System time (`datetime.now()`)
- ❌ Direct file I/O or network calls
- ❌ Non-deterministic libraries

**Allowed in Workflows**:

- ✅ `workflow.now()` (deterministic time)
- ✅ `workflow.random()` (deterministic random)
- ✅ Pure functions and calculations
- ✅ Calling activities (non-deterministic operations)
