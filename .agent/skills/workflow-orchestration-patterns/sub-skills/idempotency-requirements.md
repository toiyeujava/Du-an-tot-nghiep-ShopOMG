# Idempotency Requirements

**Why Critical** (Source: docs.temporal.io/activities):

- Activities may execute multiple times
- Network failures trigger retries
- Duplicate execution must be safe

**Implementation Strategies**:

- Idempotency keys (deduplication)
- Check-then-act with unique constraints
- Upsert operations instead of insert
- Track processed request IDs
