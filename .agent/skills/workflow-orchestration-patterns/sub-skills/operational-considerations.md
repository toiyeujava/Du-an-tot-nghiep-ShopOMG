# Operational Considerations

**Monitoring**:

- Workflow execution duration
- Activity failure rates
- Retry attempts and backoff
- Pending workflow counts

**Scalability**:

- Horizontal scaling with workers
- Task queue partitioning
- Child workflow decomposition
- Activity batching when appropriate

- Saga Pattern: temporal.io/blog/saga-pattern-made-easy

**Key Principles**:

1. Workflows = orchestration, Activities = external calls
2. Determinism is non-negotiable for workflows
3. Idempotency is critical for activities
4. State preservation is automatic
5. Design for failure and recovery
