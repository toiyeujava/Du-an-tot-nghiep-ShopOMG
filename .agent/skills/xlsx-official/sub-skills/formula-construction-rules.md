# Formula Construction Rules

#### Assumptions Placement
- Place ALL assumptions (growth rates, margins, multiples, etc.) in separate assumption cells
- Use cell references instead of hardcoded values in formulas
- Example: Use =B5*(1+$B$6) instead of =B5*1.05

#### Formula Error Prevention
- Verify all cell references are correct
- Check for off-by-one errors in ranges
- Ensure consistent formulas across all projection periods
- Test with edge cases (zero values, negative numbers)
- Verify no unintended circular references

#### Documentation Requirements for Hardcodes
- Comment or in cells beside (if end of table). Format: "Source: [System/Document], [Date], [Specific Reference], [URL if applicable]"
- Examples:
  - "Source: Company 10-K, FY2024, Page 45, Revenue Note, [SEC EDGAR URL]"
  - "Source: Company 10-Q, Q2 2025, Exhibit 99.1, [SEC EDGAR URL]"
  - "Source: Bloomberg Terminal, 8/15/2025, AAPL US Equity"
  - "Source: FactSet, 8/20/2025, Consensus Estimates Screen"

# XLSX creation, editing, and analysis

## Overview

A user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of an .xlsx file. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.

## Important Requirements

**LibreOffice Required for Formula Recalculation**: You can assume LibreOffice is installed for recalculating formula values using the `recalc.py` script. The script automatically configures LibreOffice on first run

## Reading and analyzing data
