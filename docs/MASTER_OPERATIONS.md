## 🛠️ 1. Prerequisites
To operate at 100% capacity, you should install:
- **Node.js**: For installation and package management (Requires v18+).
- **Python 3.x**: (**Recommended**) For Skills to execute automated scripts like Scanners, Evaluators, and Data Science tasks.

## 🚀 2. Quick Start

To install or update the system globally, use the following commands:

- **New Installation**: `npx antigravity-ide [project-name]`
- **Quick Init**: `npx antigravity-ide --skip-prompts` (Use default configuration).
- **Update Features**: `npx antigravity-ide` (Running this inside a project folder automatically triggers an update).

## 🏎️ 2. Engine Modes
AntiGravity supports two flexible operating modes based on project needs:

- **Standard Mode (Node.js)**: 
  - *Goal*: Lightweight, Speed, Zero-Config.
  - *Usage*: Web Projects, Portfolios, SaaS (Small/Medium).
- **Advanced Mode (Python)**:
  - *Goal*: Deep Tech, High Security, Complex AI.
  - *Usage*: Enterprise, Big Data, Pentesting.

## 🧬 4. DNA Resources (`.shared/`)
This stores the system's "genetic code", helping the Agent get smarter with every version:

| Module | Intellectual Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| `ai-master` | LLM Strategies, RAG patterns & Agentic Workflow. |
| `api-standards` | OpenAPI Standards, REST, Auth patterns & Error handling. |

| `seo-master` | E-E-A-T Optimization, Schema JSON-LD & Web Vitals. |
| `compliance` | GDPR/HIPAA Standards and Privacy Policy templates. |
| `domain-blueprints` | Industry Architectures: Fintech, Healthcare, Logistics, F&B... |
| `infra-blueprints` | Infrastructure-as-Code: Docker, Terraform, K8s, Vercel configs. |
| `metrics` | Performance metrics and code quality indicators. |
| `vitals-templates` | Benchmarks for High-Performance projects. |
| `malware-protection` | Virus scanning, malicious links & supply chain dependency control. |
| `auto-update` | Evaluation protocol for self-upgrading the Agent's brain. |
| `error-logging` | Automated error logging and runtime failure learning system. |

## 🛡️ 5. Preserving Custom Content (Markers)
When you run `update`, AntiGravity IDE syncs system files but **respects** what you've written.

To prevent AI from overwriting your critical code, use markers:
```javascript
// [CUSTOM_START]
// Write your own code or notes here...
// The system will never touch this area during updates.
const myPrivateApiKey = "xyz"; 
// [CUSTOM_END]
```

## ⌨️ 6. Slash Command System (`/`)
Use **`/`** in the chat box to summon 22 specialized operational workflows (See details in `docs/WORKFLOW_GUIDE.vi.md`).

## 🏗️ 7. "Vietnamese Shell - English Core" Principle
- **Communication**: Fully localized in Vietnamese for easy reporting and understanding.
- **Technical**: 100% English for variables, functions, and logic to ensure AI processes strictly and accurately.
